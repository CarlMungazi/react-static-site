Inflammation of the epiglottis and surrounding structures. The most common cause is haemophilus influenza type B (Hib). Since the introduction and immunisation programme of Hib, epiglottis is now rare in children.

- Anxiety
- Non-barking cough

## Diagnosis

Epiglottitis is usually a clinical diagnosis. Fibre-optic laryngoscopy remains the gold standard diagnostic investigation.

- Conservation management in ICU with intravenous or oral ceftriaxone or cefotaxime and an anti-staph antibiotic.
