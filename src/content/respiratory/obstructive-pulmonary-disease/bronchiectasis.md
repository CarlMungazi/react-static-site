title: Bronchiectasis
description: It's all about the heart
---

Permanent abnormal dilation of the bronchus. This is usually due to repeated infections, most notably because of cystic fibrosis. 

## Signs and Symptoms

The patient will present with continued recurrent infections causing a chronic productive cough and hemoptysis. Crackles will be auscultated on exam. 

## Diagnosis

- Sputum sample
- Chest X-ray
- Post-bronchodilator spirometry
- Gold standard is CT scan 

## Management

- Chest physiotherapy
- Antibiotics for an acute exacerbation
- Sputum should be cultured with every infection and the patient treated based on prior cultures and sensitivities
- Inhaled antibiotics are given to those at high risk for pseudomonas infection (risks include cystic fibrosis, repeated infection, and repeated antibiotic use)
- Long term azithromycin has also been shown to have benefit in reducing exacerbations and improving lung function
- Lung transplantation is the the gold standard treatment but it is usually done if the above fail
