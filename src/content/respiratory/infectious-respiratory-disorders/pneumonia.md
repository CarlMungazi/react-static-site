An acute infection of the lung parenchyma. 

Community acquired pneumonia (CAP) is defined by infection acquired before or at most 48 hours after admission.

Hospital acquired pneumonia (HAP) is defined as infection acquired after at least 48 hours after admission and is not incubating at time of incubation.

Pneumonia is usually caused by bacterial infection with the most common pathogen being Streptococcus pneumoniae.

## Signs and Symptoms

- Cough
- Fever
- Pleuritic chest pain
- Increased vocal fremitus and egophony
- Dullness to percussion
- Coarse crackles 

## Diagnosis

- Sputum culture is done to isolate the etiology
- A chest X-ray is usually used to diagnose pneumonia and these are some of the findings on the X-ray;
- Lobar consolidation is due to typical bacteria
- Bilateral interstitial infiltrates are usually associated with viruses and pneumocystis
- Blood cultures if patient is admitted

## Management

- CRB-65 should be used to assess if a patient suspected to have CAP should be admitted.
- Confusion
- Respiratory rate over 30
- BP systolic less than 90 mmHg or diastolic of 60 mmHg or less
- 65 years of age or over

Treatment in the community (according to clinical judgement) with amoxicillin 500 mg three times daily for 5 days, can be given to someone with a CRB-65 score of 0-1.

Admission is usually advised but treatment in the community with dual therapy combination amoxicillin 500 mg three times daily and clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily for 7-10 days, or monotherapy treatment with doxycycline for 7-10 days, can be given with close observation to someone with a CRB-65 score of 2.

Urgent hospital admission is advised for someone with a CRB-65 score of 3 or more.
